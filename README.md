# Overview

This project is focused on applying **data analysis techniques** using Python and Pandas to better understand logistics operations and predictive maintenance. As a software engineer in training, my goal is to strengthen my skills in **data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and documentation** while working with a real-world dataset.

The dataset contains logistics and maintenance information, including vehicle IDs, maintenance requirements, and operational data. It was obtained from [Kaggleâ€™s Logistics and Maintenance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) (replace with the exact dataset link you used).  

The purpose of this project is to analyze logistics performance and identify patterns that can help predict when maintenance is required, which is crucial in reducing downtime and optimizing operational efficiency.

# Data Analysis Results

Here are some of the key questions explored and the results found in this project:

1. **Which vehicle types require maintenance most frequently?**  
      Vehicle that require maintenance the most is Van with maintenanc count of 50850

2. **Which vehicle make required the most maintenance?**  
      The vehicle makes that required the most maintenance as follow: 1. Ford F-150, 2. Chevy Silverado, 3. Tesla Semi, and 4. Volvo FH

3. **What is the average maintenance cost by maintenance type?**  
      Average Maintenance Cost by Type are: 
      Maintenance_Type
      Engine Overhaul            4005.358675
      Tire Rotation              299.938745
      Oil Change                 299.064409
   
4. **What is the most common types of vehicle issues?**
   The most common vehicles issues are: 1. Oil Change, 2. Tire Rotation, and 3. Engine Overhaul
   
5. **Does higher usage hours increase likelihood of requiring maintenance?**
   Yes, high usage hour increase likelihood of maintenance required

# Future Work

Some improvements and extensions planned for the future include:

* Add **predictive modeling** to forecast maintenance requirements using machine learning.  
* Automate **data cleaning and reporting pipelines** for ongoing logistics monitoring.  
* Build a **dashboard (Power BI or Plotly Dash)** for real-time visualization of vehicle performance and maintenance trends.  
* Expand the dataset by integrating additional logistics data (fuel consumption, distance traveled, downtime).
